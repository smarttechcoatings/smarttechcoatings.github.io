title: Policy or Polarcoat?

<p>As cited on our blog recently, here:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>More than 45 percent said they go to work sick because they can’t afford to lose pay. More than 46 percent said they didn’t want to let their co-workers down by not showing up for a shift. When managers were asked how many employees they thought came to work sick, the majority answered just 18 percent.</p>

<p>So which will you choose to take up the fight against microbes? Policy or Polarcoat?</p>
