title: Polarcoat v.s. Hygienic Wall Cladding
---

<p>The following is a quote from an article about the history of germ theory</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, we understand that infectious diseases like flu, chickenpox and pneumonia are caused by microscopic organisms – bacteria  and viruses. Without this knowledge, we might have never developed ways to treat and prevent such infections. However, this understanding – known as the ‘germ theory’ of disease – was a remarkably recent discovery.</p>

<p>People have created theories to explain human disease for millennia: the Greek physician Hippocrates, born in 460 BCE, thought that ‘bad air’ from swampy areas was to blame. In the 19th century, improvements in microscope technology enabled a generation of microbiologists to investigate further the world of previously unseen disease-causing organisms.<p>

<p>Every area of human life has been impacted by the weight of these discoveries. Construction is no exception. For as long as we have been aware the threat that microbes can pose, we have been trying to make our environments safer. The need for vigilance is only increased when the environment is connected to foods (I'm talking to you Pubs, Restaurants, Refrigeration Units and Food Distributors). One approach is to use hygienic wall cladding</p>

<p>How does Polarcoat stack up against hygienic wall cladding? Well pretty well actually (otherwise we wouldn't be writing this). Consider the following three elements often required for hygienic wall cladding:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    A qualified carpenter.
    </li>
    <li>
    Complicated technical specifications.
    </li>
    <li>
    Labor intensive application
    </li>
    <li>
    Application requires that the area/environment be disrupted (all food and goods need to be removed)
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Polarcoat was developed specifically for use in Cold rooms, walk in freezers and cold storage facilities, medical facilities and cleanrooms where an easy to clean surface really matters. Polarcoat offers virtual renewal without the disruption and expense of replacing of wall or ceiling panels. The highlights?</p>

<ul>
<li>
    Carpenters aren't needed to apply paint.
</li>
<li>
    Simple application steps.
</li>
<li>
 Painless, straightforward application.
</li>
<li>
    Polarcoat is the refigeration and cleanroom coating that applies to cold, damp walls without disrupting the environment.
</li>
</ul>

<p>Polarcoat offers virtual renewal with minimal operational disruption less time, less expense, less downtime.
